Audioserve
==========

Simple personal server to serve audiofiles files from folders.  Intended primarily for audio books, but anything with decent folder structure will do.

This is pre-alpha version - basically PoC. Works locally, if client is served from other webserver.

Server is in Rust,  client is intended for modern browser (simple ES6 javascript).
